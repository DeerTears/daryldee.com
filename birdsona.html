        <h1>Reasons to get a birdsona</h1>
        <p>Here are 10 reasons to get a birdsona (nsfw)</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You're often a niche species, which makes you special.</li>
            <li>If you want to support niche artists, having a birdsona is a great way to weed out the usual artist selection of dog-drawers. This is more of a curse than a blessing but I figured I'd add it anyway.</li>
            <li>You get a lot of flexibility when creating your character. You don't need to have wings, or bird feet. You can take the griffin approach of lion-like feet, or human-like feet with scutes and talons. Heck, you can have a set of feet talons and opposable thumbs and hand talons. Your beak size and general stature can be different from the core species that you draw on.</li>
            <li>A lot of birds do not have sexual dimorphism, so how your bird presents gender could be entirely irrespective of their other sexual features. <b>SPECIAL REQUEST:</b> can we cool it with the jokes about male anthro birds being mistaken for female anthro birds because of their cloaca? it's so boring and old and nobody thinks your transphobic anthro bird porn is funny. just fucking make it hot and intimate. destroy that male cloaca with style. if you're gonna drop another "it's just like a girl's" you can fully miss me with that shit, go back to grade school english class and write some real dialogue for a change.</li>
            <li>Birds don't pee but you could make your birdsona pee and I think that's cool.</li>
            <li>One hole to rule them all. The entire 6th point is just here to emphasize how good that phrase is.</li>
            <li>Birdsong is a unique way to communicate, you can incorporate it into your character's traits, or even create your own birdsong to be sung in unique situations. Perhaps a loved one inspires them to create a new birdsong just for them. For example, daryl is a chickadee, but struggles to sing his natural birdsong, so he uses anthropomorphic speech to convey his feelings and ideas. He also uses music production to sample other chickadees to imbue his origins in the music.</li>
            <li>If your birdsona lays eggs, you can always have eggs to donate to others or to have as a snack. Free eggs whenever you like! Don't think about the exchange of energy. Also it's vegetarian because it's far from being hatched or even fertilized!</li>
            <li>As an ambivert and a therian, I find bird theriotypes pair well with my natural curiosity of new people and my overall independent behaviours. I'm not really doing what Patricia Taxxon describes in her video about meeting new people like a real dog would. I just have a different style and doing bird-like behaviours on my own put me at ease and make me feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li>You get sent funny bird pictures and videos from friends because this is the one thing they know for sure is not going to get old for you.</li>
            <li><b>BONUS</b>: Drawing kissing becomes an extra challenge if you're into that sorta thing!
