      <h2>species</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>part chestnut-chickadee (wings)</li>
        <li>part carolina chickadee (body pattern)</li>
        <li>just as likely could be some corvid with a lot of feather dye</li>
      </ul>
      <p>although has been once observed making iconic "dee dee dee" sounds, his markings look more that of a chestnut chickadee. meanwhile, his body size and beak shape are far more corvid-like. we don't know if this is a corvid pretending to be a songbird, or something else entirely. he seems to be happiest identifying with the "dee" name.</p>

      <h2>diet</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>fruit + nut smoothies</li>
        <li>salted nuts</li>
        <li>kale</li>
        <li>starburst candies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>after having an unpleasant awakening to frat boy culture and college kid cuisine, he takes it upon himself to make nutty berry smoothies with various powders and vegetables in them. he's also a fan of kombucha, wine, and essentially anything fruity and fermented.</p>
      <p>he always has a mild moral quandry about eating bugs, even though other birds of his type do so without hesitation.</p>
      <h2>song</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>spoken</li>
        <li>lyrical</li>
        <li>scratchy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>while he isn't able to make the same kind of calls that his ancestors once could, he likes to rhyme and make tongue-in-cheek wordplay out of english to find the same joys most songbirds get from song.</p>
      <h2>behaviour</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>
            energetic around others
          </li>
          <li>
            needs lots of introspection time
          </li>
          <li>plays social games whenever possible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          he spends his time away from the studio playing counter strike 1.6 (and any retro-revival shooters) with his old clan from high school.
        </p>

      <h2>sleep</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>always stays up late</li>
        <li>always sleeps in late</li>
        <li>thoughts often race in bed, gets up to satisfy creative desires</li>
        <li>naps better than he sleeps</li>
      </ul>
      <p>in the rare times that he is seen sleeping, he always sleeps lying down with his wings behind his head. he greatly prefers hammocks, crevices in tree branches, and other high-up locations.</p>
